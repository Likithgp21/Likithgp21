✨ Likith GP
🐍 Python Developer | Machine Learning & NLP Enthusiast

Hello, my name is Likith, and I’m a Python Developer with over 2 years of hands-on experience in designing and implementing data-driven solutions. I’m passionate about leveraging machine learning, deep learning, and NLP to solve complex real-world problems through intelligent automation and predictive insights.Throughout my journey, I’ve built and deployed multiple end-to-end machine learning applications, gaining expertise in data preprocessing, model development, and performance optimization. My foundation in Python and core ML concepts has evolved through projects spanning predictive analytics, computer vision, and natural language processing, each crafted from the ground up — from ideation and planning to production-level execution.Currently, I’m focused on strengthening my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) skills to enhance my technical depth and problem-solving abilities, aligning with my long-term goal of becoming a technically proficient and innovative developer.

🔹 I specialize in:
1.	Python, Flask, Django, and FastAPI
2.	Machine Learning (Scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM)
3.	Deep Learning (TensorFlow, Keras, CNNs, RNNs)
4.	NLP (Transformers, BERT, spaCy, NLTK)
5.	Data Structures and Algorithms

🔹 Currently:
1.	Sharpening my DSA skills for strong technical growth
2.	Exploring AI-powered web apps using Flask and React
3.	Contributing to open-source ML projects
